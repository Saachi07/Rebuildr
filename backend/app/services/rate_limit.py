"""Tiny in-memory sliding-window rate limiter.

Protects the expensive Gemini-backed endpoints (photo scans, document
analysis) from runaway clients burning the shared API quota. Per-process
only: each worker keeps its own counters, so the effective limit scales
with worker count. That is acceptable for the current single-process
deployment; swap in a shared store (Redis, Postgres) if the app ever runs
behind multiple workers and the limits need to be exact.
