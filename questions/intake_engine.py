"""
The adaptive intake engine.

This wraps the trained decision tree to do Akinator-style adaptive
questioning. At each step, given the answers so far, it:

  1. Runs Monte Carlo inference to get the predicted distribution over
     plans, treating unanswered features as random draws from their
     training-data marginals.
  2. If one plan already has probability >= CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD, stops
     and returns the plan.
  3. Otherwise, picks the next question by expected information gain:
     for each unanswered question, simulates each possible answer,
     measures how much it would reduce the entropy of the prediction,
     and picks the question with the biggest expected drop.

State is held externally (in `answers` dicts you pass in), so the engine
is safe to share across requests in a Flask app — just instantiate it
once at startup.
